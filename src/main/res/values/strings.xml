&#8226; This app demonstrates the Cogs massively-parallel high-throughput distributed message broker system using GSM and a rules engine to set the impact threshold.<br/>
&#8226; The impact sensor runs in the background, and only sends events if a minimum impact is sensed.<br/>
&#8226; Cogswell also includes a rules engine and NoSQL DB.<br/>
&#8226; <b>All of this power can be in your hands:</b>  We have SDKs in C#, Java, javascript, Android and iOS.<br/>
